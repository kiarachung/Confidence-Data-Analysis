This repository analyses confidence data from Open Science Framework (OSF) datasets, comparing equal-variance and unequal-variance signal detection theory (SDT) models. The analysis builds on published confidence datasets, fitting and evaluating SDT frameworks to better understand how people report certainty in binary decision tasks.
